## What is YamAPI?

YamAPI is a robust Minecraft API designed to retrieve images of blocks and items. Currently, it is optimized for new Minecraft worlds, excluding snapshots. However, we are actively enhancing its capabilities. In the near future, modders will be able to upload their own textures, making YamAPI a comprehensive resource for Minecraft textures, catering to both vanilla and modded versions.

At present, YamAPI operates as a straightforward Cloudflare workers API. Our future vision includes the development of a separate page for viewing all routes and available mods with textures on YamAPI. Importantly, all these advancements will be open source. Our primary goal is not profit, but the enrichment of the Minecraft community.

## How can we sustain YamAPI?

We are exploring various avenues to find cost-effective hosting solutions as we are committed to building open-source products. Additionally, we are actively seeking partnerships and sponsorships to support the future development and maintenance of YamAPI.
